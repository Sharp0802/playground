## What is QuietOffliner
* * *
When the server they request detects it as a bot,
Many web-scrapper programs often return "403 Forbidden".

Depending on the site, it may last a long time.

QuietOffliner bypasses the server's detection of
abnormal http headers by making requests
by mimicking the http request headers
requested by Google Chrome to minimize this phenomenon.

(But this means,
this program requires you to write code
for every site you want to apply)
